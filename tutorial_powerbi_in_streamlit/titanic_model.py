"""
Next, letâ€™s make a model and save it in pickle file to avoid recalculation of the model every time.
For this example, I have used simple Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn for binary classification.
Our target variable is Survived. Let us see, how to make a pickle file.
Name the model building file as titanic_model.py.
